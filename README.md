# Todo List with useReducer and useContext

This project is a todo list built with React's useReducer and useContext hooks. It allows users to add, delete, and edit tasks in a simple and intuitive way.

The app is composed of two main components: the `TodoList` component which holds the list of tasks, and the `Todo` component which allows users to add new tasks. The `TodoList` component uses the `useReducer` hook to manage its state, while the `Todo` component uses the `useContext` hook to access the state from the `TodoList`.
